We provide an analysis of the basal response of basilar membrane (BM)
and cilia response for low frequency tonal stimulation.
In the base, the BM impedance is $K_0 e^{-2ax}/i \omega$
while the scala impedance is $i \omega \rho c A(x)$.
Thus the pressure is very close to that in a ridged-walled
box, namely $P(x) = i \omega \rho c (L-x) u_{st}$, since
the BM impedance is much greater than the scala impedance.
It follows from Hooke's Law that the BM displacement
must vary in an exponential manner with place:
$\xi(x,\omega) = - \omega^2 \rho c (L-x) u_{st} e^{2ax}/K_0$.

Hair cells are known to be displacement detectors (Hudspeth and Corey, 1977).
Above 1 kHz Dallos has found that the inner hair
cell (IHC) responds to the shear displacement of the sub-tectorial
space.  Direct measurements of the neural
population by Kim et al., as well as transformations of populations
of neural tuning curves from frequency to place (Allen, 1991),
have shown that the basal neural response
is independent of $x$. These results are consistent with
two-tone suppression (Fahey and Allen, 1979)
(and upward spread of masking) data which show that
the low frequency suppression threshold is
approximately independent of frequency.

There are two possible explanations for the above contradiction.
Either the inner and outer hair cell sensitivity must vary as
$e^{-2ax}$, or the micromechanics of the tectorial membrane must
transform the BM displacement shear signal from exponential to a constant
place dependence. The evidence for a gradient in cilia sensitivity is in the
direction of increased sensitivity for lower frequencies,
because the cilia increase in length with place. This
leaves us with the option that the TM to cilia stiffness
ratio must vary as $e^{-2ax}$ to compensate for the $e^{2ax}$
dependence of the BM displacement.

A simple and natural solution to all these requirements is to assume that the
linear component of the partition stiffness is dominated by the
TM radial stiffness.  Model results support these conclusions.
